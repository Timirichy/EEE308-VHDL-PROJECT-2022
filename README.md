# EEE308-VHDL-PROJECT-2022
Project work for EEE308 project work, on the topic; "Digital Stop clock with moving text display"
This is a FPGA,s VHDl code
The STP_WTCH.vhd is the main code in which the Pl_CLK.vhd and Dis_CLK.vhd are subsidiary codes which are port-mapped into the STP_WTCH.vhd  code.
The STP_WTCH.qpf is the overall project in Quartus II Prime Lite format
The STP_WTCH.qsf contains the Pin assignment for the Intel DE10-Lite FPGA board of the "MAX 10 10M50DAF484C7G Device"
